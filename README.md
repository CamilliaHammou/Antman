# Antman
This project consists of two binaries 'antman' and 'giantman.' 'Antman' compresses files, while 'giantman' recovers compressed files to their original state. The compression is lossless and can handle different types of input files. The goal is to achieve efficient compression without an unreasonable runtime, even for large files.
